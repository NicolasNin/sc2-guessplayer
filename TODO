TODO
------------------
test other features

------------------
analyse a replay or a db through different stats:
--> look at the pure frequency of hotkeys
--> look at the time between hotkey : % of 0, % of 1 etc...
--> fn hotkey

visualization:
--> hotkey=f(frame) scater plot
--> visualize matrix of a player
--> matrix of corelation between two player (or the same)
--> hotkey cycle in a circle viz
web-interface:
--> python server and cgi script with pickle ?
--> model 2 (mvc)

OTHER:
try to paralelize NN search (openmp??)
write code to use scikit
--> separate each db in 3 dbs... can be done in the db class
-->then you have to do every test on each 3 DB for each race

--> calculate corelation between players of 2 db (or oneself)
--> compute the graph of plyaers and display it
write something to have per player stats (ie percentage of failure )

improve the score structure:
indeed: we have as feature for now:
-matrix (2 cycle) ->100
-frequency(1 cycle)->10
-"APM"
-gap frequency  --> maxgap feature
we should be able to have a mix of those with parameter and weight
----------TIME FRAME ----------------
Mer 10/02 20h:  can analyse replay and have first view of hotkey scater
Jeu 11/02 15h:  got result at 85% no data on %
Ven 12/02 20h:  got an evaluation of algos, looks for autocorelation and simple corellation
Sam 13:02 -- :  Not working
Dim 14/02    :  file p1 and p2, looks to improve the structure of code, start using scikit with mixed results
Lun 15/02 20h:  Code anew to have a better structure more akin to scikit estimator, add APM feature,create github
Mar 16/02 14h:  Test APM with different Database (working a few hours) add features to test in the night
Time spent: around 5 days
