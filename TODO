TODO
------------------
test other features

------------------
analyse a replay or a db through different stats:
--> look at the pure frequency of hotkeys
--> look at the time between hotkey : %age of 0, %age of 1 etc...
--> 

visualization:
--> hotkey=f(frame) scater plot
--> visualize matrix of a player
--> matrix of corelation between two player (or the same)

web-interface:
--> python server and cgi script with pickle ?
--> model 2 (mvc)

----------TIME FRAME ----------------
Mer 10/02 20h:  can analyse replay and have first view of hotkey scater
Jeu 11/02 15h:  got result at 85% no data on %
Ven 12/02 20h:  got an evaluation of algos, looks for autocorelation and simple corellation
Sam 13:02 -- :  Not working
Dim 14/02    :  file p1 and p2, looks to improve the structure of code, start using scikit with mixed results
Lun 15/02 20h:  Code anew to have a better structure more akin to scikit estimator, add APM feature,create github
